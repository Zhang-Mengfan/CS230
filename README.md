# CS230-Final-Project

This is my final project for CS230 at Stanford, taught by Andrew Ng.

With the modern remote sensing technology, building and structural component images become accessible via aerial drones or related devices. In this project, the state-of-the-art deep learning technology for a civil engineering application is implemented, namely recognition of structural damage from images.

With in-depth hyperparameter tuning with VGG16 and Multi-model training, we rank at ~15% among other competitors.
