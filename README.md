# CS230-Final-Project

This is my final project for CS230 at Stanford, taught by Andrew Ng.

Recent studies in the field of structural engineering raise eyes on the importance of post-earthquake recovery in urban areas. With the modern remote sensing technology, building and structural component images become accessible via aerial drones or related devices. In this project, the state-of-the-art deep learning technology for a civil engineering application is implemented, namely recognition of structural damage from images.

With in-depth hyperparameter tuning with VGG16 and Multi-model training, we rank at ~15% among other competitors. There is space to improve by tuning parameters in the multi-model method.
